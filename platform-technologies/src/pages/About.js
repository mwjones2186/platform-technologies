                    <p>
                        Platform Imaging is an early-stage medical device company perfecting and commercializing disposable, miniaturized, autonomous, visualization devices for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) to enhance visualization, decrease the surgical footprint and restore complete autonomy and control of the camera to the surgeon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Devices and techniques for routine laparoscopic procedures have not changed in nearly 40 years. As responsible innovators, it is our responsibility to develop devices that are less invasive to the patient, achieve better outcomes for the surgeon while lowering costs for healthcare facilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We invite you to learn more about Platform Imaging and our commitment to improving outcomes in minimally invasive surgery.
